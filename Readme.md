# Data Structures & Algorithms

## My Goals
This repository represents my journey in learning data structures and algorithms and how to solve problems using the knowledge I gathered. All of the problems solved and the code written in this repository was done by me, with the goal of getting *1st*, *2nd* or *3rd* award at the national competition in programming in Serbia, which I achieved in 2024.

## Participations in competitions

- **2024 Serbian national competition in programming** - qualified and won *3rd* award (118 points, 15th place overall) ([final results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FemAtnjQLes61sEUYRIoyi8gu9ImfMZhGLUm2eybs9Q/edit?gid=483596900#gid=483596900&range=C17))
- **2023 Serbian national competition in programming** - qualified and participated (90 points, 48th place overall) ([final results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13ciCPxKbe37P-ghbBxo6EM0iMQr96xBODQm0_9KZYHk/edit?gid=833310427#gid=833310427&range=C53))
- **2022 Serbian national competition in programming** - qualified and participated (30 points, 57th place overall) ([final results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sxfk0u1jghxMWME0PszBoRYE--h4Q9Bml9-IY6Ta4UE/edit?gid=1831798149#gid=1831798149&range=C65))

## Platforms

- The platform I use the most for practice is [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com) and you can find my profile right [here](https://codeforces.com/profile/0gnjen1).
- This is the platform that powers the competitions in competitive programming in Serbia, [Petlja](https://petlja.org/).
- [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/) (Code Submission Evaluation System) is the website I use to practice problems from specific topics.
