# Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository represents my journey in mastering advanced data structures and algorithms. All of the code was written with the goal of improving my skills and getting to the podium at the Nationals in Competitive Programming in Serbia.


## Platforms


- The platform I use the most for practice is [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com) and you can find my profile right [here](https://codeforces.com/profile/0gnjen1).
- This is the platform that powers the competitions in Competitive Programming in Serbia, [Petlja](https://petlja.org/).
- [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/) (Code Submission Evaluation System) is the website I use to test algorithms and data structures that I write so that I can use them when needed.

## Participation in competitions

- In the year 2022 I participated at the Competitive Programming competition at the national level, but didn't have enough success to be happy with the results. You can find me on the official invitation list in [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rpLy9q1PURNm9bf60-msnyXfWow4rQYBOSV-IQD4dfk/edit#gid=803515200) spreadsheet. ( my username is 0gnjen1 there too :D )
