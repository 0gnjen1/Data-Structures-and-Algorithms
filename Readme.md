# Data Structures & Algorithms

## My Goals
This repository represents my journey in mastering advanced data structures and algorithms. All of the problems solved and the code written was with the goal of getting *1st*, *2nd* or *3rd* place at the national competition in programming in Serbia.

## Platforms

- The platform I use the most for practice is [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com) and you can find my profile right [here](https://codeforces.com/profile/0gnjen1).
- This is the platform that powers the competitions in competitive programming in Serbia, [Petlja](https://petlja.org/).
- [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/) (Code Submission Evaluation System) is the website I use to practice problems from specific topics.
